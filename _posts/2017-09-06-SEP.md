**What we discovered**
Learning | Area
--- | ---
ðŸ’¡**My Account wireframes round 2** |   	
Users loved the clearer page layouts	| Layout
Privacy policies still scare or bore people	| User Sentiment
Descriptive text needs to be visually grouped with the thing it relates to (Help text obviously connected with a form field etcâ€¦)	| Layout
call to action text on buttons is critical to get right. It must be tested. 	| Layout/Navigation
Primary and Secondary call to actionâ€™s need to be made more obviously hierarchical	| Navigation
When things go wrong, we have to be much more obvious about pointing it out. 	| Alerts/Notifications
ðŸ’¡**My Account homepage prototypes**  	|
the simplest page was preferred	| Layout
users liked colour to help distinguish sections	| Layout/Navigation
