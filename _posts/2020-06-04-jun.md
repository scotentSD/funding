“Clearly laid out and easy to understand. The questions gave all definitions where needed and I was able to follow and mentally answer each one.” |
“I would need to understand some of the criteria a little more in order to be able to answer yes or no - for example the questions about high growth and innovation”. |
“The questions were clear, but would need some research on my part”. |
“I don’t know what a "sanctions restricted person" is”.
“Business sectors offered do not include all activities, including those of my company”. |
