**What we discovered**

| Learning
| ---
| ðŸ’¡  **Wireframes for the new SIB product online application form**
| This process compares very positively to users experiences of other funding applications
| All users could easily navigate & complete the form, submit, review and sign in
| Creating an account was an issue
| Evidence section needs to more explicitly state that as long as all of the information is included, it doesnâ€™t need to be in individual documents
| Users want to see a full list of documents needed in before you apply, especially ones that need filled in, such as economic impact/business plan
| Some issues of clarity remain where users ideally want more definition/ examples

ðŸ§° **We Changed**

| Change
| ---
| Evidence - emphasise if info is uploaded in another document you donâ€™t need to duplicate it. Add to the backlog to explore alternative patterns, including possible single upload option alongside list of requirements. Tell the user up front what documents are needed.
| Company director - move question from declarations to eligibility. Add text to question in Contact Details stating they must be a director as registered on Companies House.
| HMRC question â€“ explain outstanding payments donâ€™t include any COVID-19 related payment break agreed with HMRC.
| Account sign-up process â€“ add to the backlog for changes, explore alternative patterns for example reveal the password fields after the verification code is complete.
| Add definition of â€˜sanctions restricted personâ€™. Consider adding examples of capital expenditure and working capital.
| Set expectations at review page, what is the next stage and how long will it take.
