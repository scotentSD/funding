**What we discovered**

| Learning
| ---
| 💡  **Early Stage Growth Challenge Fund: file upload page**
| Majority of users were clear on how to upload documents to each version of the page.
| Preference was to upload documents under each category.
| 60% of users preferred version D. It was found to be easier to track and match documents to each section as opposed to uploading all at once.
| Version D layout was also preferred due to the 3 clear sections and smaller drag and drop box under each.
| Users found ‘Browse Files’ section logical and straightforward. Preference was for file ‘options’ to be numbered and match evidence description, to help match documents quickly and easily.

**🎧 Quotes**

| Quote
| ---
| On Version D: “The text sizes were perfect and the upload window was displayed very well under the respected sections.”
| On Version D: “Best version so far, clear concise with the best drag & drop box size and lay out”.
| On ‘browse files’: “Excellent, this is how older professionals like myself remember the user interface of pages. Normally, you see buttons everywhere which can be rather confusing.”
| On ‘browse files’: “It’s clear and is a good way of prompting me to make sure that all required evidence is contained in the various documents I upload.”
| On Version C: “The layout is compacted and the browse files section interferes with the description of each section, which is not good for user readability.”


🧰 **We Changed**  

| Change
| ---
| Develop file upload section based on Version D design.
| Add descriptions to the evidence options in the dropdown's to reflect the names of each piece of evidence and number each option to make it easier and faster to match documents to the evidence.
