**What we discovered**

| Learning
| ---
| üí°**multi file upload design*
| Users were very clear how to upload documents to this page
| The file upload process was easy, user friendly and intuitive for users
| Majority of users found linking the file uploaded to the evidence required easy
| Text attached to the evidence options would have made it clearer for users who were confused
| 70% of users could easily remove evidence when it had been uploaded, 30% could not or were unclear whether they had done it or not

üß∞ **We Changed**  

| Change
| ---
| Change the options from number to text, corresponding to the evidence detailed above, or number the text options. This will make the link between document and corresponding evidence clearer to users.
| Consider user suggestions to include information on file types and sizes accepted and a confirmation pop up to confirm file removal, ex. ‚Äúare you sure you want to remove this file?‚Äù
