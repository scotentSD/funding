   - NOISE
   - Not sure who to talk to
   - Time Poor
   - The information is not sector specific enough
- 5 main types of customer / need
   - A. I started exporting due to an international request and had to learn very quickly
   - B. I am looking for tarrifs and customs info
   - C. I am looking for opportunities
   - D. I am looking for intermediary info (distributors etc...). "I got stung in the past"
   - Z. Doing fine alone
