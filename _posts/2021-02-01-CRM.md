## Phase 
- Alpha

## Audience
- 5 internal staff

## Focus
- What were your experiences using the CRM interface for these grants?
- What worked well?
- What didn’t work well?
- Was anything was missing?
- What would you need changed?

## What we discovered
- Differences in how staff enter records impacts what screens they see
- Not all users follow the same process to get to the same place
- Not all users have the same Views of the same screen/queue
- Need the ability to dump all the form information (fields) as a Doc/PDF to send for approval
- Staff had to cut and paste information into Word documents to send for approval
- They also want the ability to be able to view the email trail, application form and supporting documents in one place
- They want to pause SLA when customer is non-responsive (resubmitting info etc..)
- Staff want to pause the SLA when they are waiting for extra information feel that being held to an SLA for circumstances outside their control
- Text editor has gone from their screens, so they can’t format notes
- There was no warning for this and this made pulling all the data into a formatted Word document via cut and paste difficult
- Supporting docs seems to have vanished
- Staff now cannot review the entire evidence prior to submitting an application for approval or in the event of a query
- EU language needs to be reviewed (De Minimis etc..)
- Staff felt this was no longer relevant 

## Recomendations
- Ensure all staff use CRM in the same way to ensure consistency
- Restore text editor
- Allow staff to download all fields into one document
