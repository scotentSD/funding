## What we discovered

| Learning
| ---
| 💡**De Minimis still sucks as a Phrase/Term**
| De Minimis is not mentioned in the eligibility section, even though it is an “absolute requirement”
| Customers needs to be told in advance, what information documents & evidence will be “needed to successfully complete the application”, to avoid unpleasant surprises
| Private documents make people nervous about security and liability
| Business Plan’s are referenced confusingly (Repeatedly and with/without a template)

## 🎧 Quotes

| Quote
| ---
| “I already uploaded a Business Plan and **NOW** you are giving me a template?”
| “What if I want Email **AND** Phone””
| “Project Cost is too vague”
| "It would have been handy to know I needed that before we started"


## 🧰 We Changed 

| Change
| ---
| 💡**De Minimis descriptive text**
