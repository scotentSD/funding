## Phase
    Discovery

## Audience
- DDIT Staff and Stakeholders

## We were focusing on 
- Lessons learned from Previous rounds of Funding Delivery that will help with current Appraisal work

| Learning
| ---
| - The Design System is now quite stable and is producing page layouts without any innate usability problems
| - File upload preferences were referenced as this will feed into current Appraisal work being done
| - Having Files uploads in Context of the descriptive text was critical. eg. Have them at point of need and not afterwards.  




## 🎧 Quotes
