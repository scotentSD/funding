## Phase 
- Alpha

## Audience

- Potential Customers
- 6 Recruited for F2F Video Calls

## Focus

| Research Questions
| ---
| Do users understand what the different types of evidence are and what they would provide? Is it clear who’s eligible for the call? 
| Is it clear what kind of projects the call could support? 
| Is the claims content useful and would users want to know more before applying? 
| Did users find it useful to know what factors we’ll consider when reviewing applications? 
| Is there anything that’s unclear or missing? Anything users would have liked to know more about? 
| Is the language clear/do we use any unfamiliar terms? 
| Did you notice the postcode checker? If so, was it clear why this was provided?

## What we discovered

| 💡 Learning
| ---
| Language is clear
| The page is too content-heavy – users struggle to take in all of the information
| The information about claims needs to be higher up on the page
| Users need more clarity about what a green job is – some examples would be helpful
| The postcode checker is clear, but we need to ensure it's clear what to do if you aren't in the Scottish Enterprise area

## Recomendations

| Recomendations
| ---
| Investigate using accordions to make the content on the page easier to digest
| Move the claims section higher up the page
| Add some examples of what a green job is
| Link off to similar services in the HIE/SoSE areas so businesses in those areas don't hit a dead end
