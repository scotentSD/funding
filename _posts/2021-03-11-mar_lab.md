## Phase
    Discovery

## Audience
- 4 Potential Customers (Zoom)
- 10 Online unmoderated

## We were focusing on 
- Validating the Hub & Spoke Task Lists for Appraisals


## Focus
- Do labels (Attention Needed etc...) show enough detail
- Display or hide sections
- Should we hide sections that don‚Äôt need attention
- Is Text Pattern clear enough (Appraisal comments etc...)
- Application Evidence (Upload new file as an update post appraisal comments)
- Thoughts on Additional Information section
- What people expect to see when they SUBMIT


## What we discovered 

| Learning
| ---
|The labels worked wellBUTOn ‚ÄúIdentity verification details‚Äù the In Progress Label was ambiguous. Customers did not know if it was In progress with us or should they still be doing something
| It is an even split between wanting inactive sections hidden vs Showing them to show what has been completed
| Application Evidence: 
| Appraiser Comments could be more  obvious that they are from a person. 
| The Appraiser comments could reference the page better. This would include being more specific about uploading files etc‚Ä¶
| The Text Pattern on Additional Info page works quite wellBUTThe Upload additional evidence was missed often. 
| The Additional Info section was most welcome
| When customers SUBMIT it is an even split between showing a summary first or going straight to a thankyou page


üß∞ ## Recomendations 

| Change
| ---
| Change the IDV In Progress label language
| Make Appraiser Comments more explicit (Quotes pattern etc‚Ä¶)
| Make the ‚ÄúUpload Additional Evidence‚Äù link more prominent on the ‚ÄúAdditional Info‚Äù page
| A/B test: 
|    Hiding completed sections
|    The SUBMIT action
