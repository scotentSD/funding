| Learning
| ---
| De Minimis is still an unhelpful term
| De Minimis is not mentioned in the eligibility section, even though it is an “absolute requirement”
| Customers needs to be told in advance, what information documents & evidence will be “needed to successfully complete the application”, to avoid unpleasant surprises
| Private documents make people nervous about security and liability
| Business Plan’s are referenced confusingly (Repeatedly and with/without a template).

🧰 ## Recomendations 

| Change
| ---
| “What if I want Email AND Phone”
| "I already uploaded a Business Plan and”NOW” you are giving me a template? Confusing."
| “If I am not a Public Company then I don’t might not want my information to be Public”.
