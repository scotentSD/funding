| Learning

| People don't read stuff they think is already completed
| Pages are short and sweet :-)
| The design system is now producing well functioning pages
| Appraiser comments are noticed, but viewed as quite impersonal. 
| Customers asked for a Name against Appraiser comments
| Upload Evidence link was missed (Tertiary Link at bottom of page)
| The reference Number raised confidence levels
| The phone number raised confidence levels
| SLA's were expected, but missing
