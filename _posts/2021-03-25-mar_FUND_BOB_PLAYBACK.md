| The site is nice and clear but the initial toolkit view is a little bit vague
| The questionnaire is good, but some questions could have the option text tweaked
| The initial views of the Action plan was too vague for users and did not lead them deeper into the detail
| Once people clicked through to detailed content, (after being prompted), they appreciated the level of detail.
