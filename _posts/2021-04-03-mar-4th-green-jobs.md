## Audience

- Potential Customers
- 6 Recruited for F2F Video Calls

## Focus

| Research Questions
| ---
| Do usersÂ understandÂ what theÂ different types of evidenceÂ are and what they would provide? Is it clear whoâ€™sÂ eligibleÂ for the call?Â 
| Is it clear what kind of projects theÂ call could support?Â 
| Is the claims content useful and would users want to know moreÂ before applying?Â 
| Did users find it useful to know what factors weâ€™ll consider whenÂ reviewingÂ applications?Â 
| Is there anything thatâ€™sÂ unclear or missing? AnythingÂ users wouldÂ have liked to know more about?Â 
| Is theÂ languageÂ clear/do we use any unfamiliar terms?Â 
| Did you notice theÂ postcode checker? If so, was it clear why this was provided?

## What we discovered

| ðŸ’¡ Learning
| ---
| Language is clear
| The page is too content-heavy â€“ users struggle to take in all of the information
| The information about claims needs to be higher up on the page
| Users need more clarity about what a green job is â€“ some examples would be helpful
| The postcode checker is clear, but we need to ensure it's clear what to do if you aren't in the Scottish Enterprise area

## Recomendations

| Recomendations
| ---
| Investigate using accordions to make the content on the page easier to digest
| Move the claims section higher up the page
| Add some examples of what a green job is
| Link off to similar services in the HIE/SoSE areas so businesses in those areas don't hit a dead end
