## Phase
   Beta

## Audience
- 5 potential cutomers

## We were focusing on 
### Primary questions
- Does the Application Journey have any major issues?
- How long will it take users?
- How hard will they find it (Evidence etc.…)
### Secondary Questions
- How do people think they can gather the evidence?
   - is it something that they have available?
   - would they know where to go and source the information?
   - how long would it take people to gather the information together?
- Does the new language on the “project plan” make sense to people?


## What we discovered

| 💡**lightbulb moment**
| Does the Application Journey have any major issues
|   - It is not obvious that it is SAVING as you go. (Do you have to submit each section or does it save each field) 
|   - **Fair Work** is not well understood by customers. 
|      - It feels like an absolute barrier to some
|      - It is not understood WHY we are asking for it
|   - Put all the things that would disqualify a user Up Front (Or make it feel that way)
|   - **RETAIL** on the banned list is too ambiguous.
|   - **Green Jobs** is not just about **Jobs** (a bit...)
| How long will it take users?
|   - A bit too long. It started to wear down people about mid way.
|   - Fair Work was the breaking point for some
| How hard will they find it (Evidence etc…)
|  - It is quite straight forward but they might flag a bit toward the middle
|  - A bit repetitive
|  - None of it seems unnecessary BUT there is a lot of it.
|  - Smaller companies would be put off. Larger companies probably get it.
