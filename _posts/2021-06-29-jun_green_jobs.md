## Phase
   Beta

## Audience
- 5 internal with A11LY requirements

## We were focusing on 
### Primary questions

- Does the Application Journey have any major issues?
- How long will it take users?
- 
### Secondary Questions

- How do people think they can gather the evidence?
- Is it something that they have available?
- Would they know where to go and source the information?
- How long would it take people to gather the information together?

## What we discovered

**The application journey has no major issues**

- It's not obvious that its saving as it goes  
- It's great that there is a list of documents required but have an option to download this to a pdf and people like to check off that they have everything  
- Bullet points are easy put info in bullet points  
- Donâ€™t use too big paragraphs  
- Well laid out and easy to read  
- Tone of language a bit casual for a government website  
- Participants expected to just  go onto the next section not to go back to the index

| How long will it take users?
|---
|It takes too long causing frustration  
|Participants with accessibility needs required considerably more time to complete the task
