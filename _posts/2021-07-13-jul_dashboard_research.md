## Phase
   Beta

## Audience
- 5 internal with A11LY requirements

## We were focusing on:
### Primary questions

- Does the dashboard have any major issues? 
- Is it what customers are expecting to see? 

### Secondary Research Questions

- Active funds and services‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØdo they notice that action is‚ÄØrequired? 
- Is it clear that action is needed for the contact offer? 
- Layout 
- Is it clear‚ÄØwhats‚ÄØexpected? 
- Can people accept or reject‚ÄØoffer? 
- Congratulations‚ÄØscreen‚ÄØ‚Äì can the go back to‚ÄØ the dashboard from here?

- ## What we discovered
**Does the dashboard have any major issues?**

- It was clear where action was needed  
- Want clear alerts 
- Were able to complete the contract offer  
- Text too fine some participants had to highlight it blue to be able to read it due to contrast issues  
- Language too informal for confirmation screens, the use of the word congratulations wasn‚Äôt felt to be appropriate  

| Is it what  customers expect to see?
|---
|Expected to see company name not SE name  
|Allow applicants to print off the contract offer and a summary of the application for their records
